## About

I am a Lecturer in the [Philosophy Department at Gonzaga University](https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/departments/philosophy). Before moving to Spokane in the Fall 2021, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Philosophy and Religion at the University of Indianapolis](https://uindy.edu/cas/philosophy-religion/faculty).

- Interests
    
    My primary area of research is in the foundations of epistemic normativity. Most of my work has been about the normativity of logic.
    
    Recently, primarily through teaching, I have grown interested in the social epistemology of conspiracy theories and fake news.
    
    I also have strong interests in Nietzsche. Two strands attract me: his brand of constitutive naturalism, and the constructive role of genealogy in his thinking.
    
- Background
    
    I received my PhD in philosophy in August 2019 from the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://phil.uic.edu/).
    
    I have a BA in Philosophy from [UC Berkeley](https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/) and a BS in Chemical Engineering from the Islamic Azad University in Tehran. 
    
    I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran and moved to the US in 2008 to study philosophy.

1. Evidence and Incoherence (revise & resubmit)
    - Abstract
        
        I argue against an ambitious account of irrationality of logical incoherence, which I labeled *Reductive Evidentialism.* This view seeks to explain away all logical/structural requirements of rationality in terms of responsiveness to evidence. I argue that this view has to be rejected because it lacks the resources to maintain one of the central assumptions that it needs, namely, *intra-*subjective uniqueness: i.e., that a given individual’s body of evidence cannot permit believing both $P$ and $\neg P$ .
        
2. [new] Coherence, Conflict, and Tragedy (under review)
    - Abstract
        
        This paper argues, contra a growing trend in the literature on the norms of rationality, that the so-called “conflict cases” do not justify modification or skepticism about norms of rationality. Conflict cases are supposed to be examples in which norms of coherence, on the one hand, and the norms of responsiveness to evidence, on the other, come into conflict. The paper argues that the illusion that these cases force us to choose between the norms of rationality can be traced to a deprived model of what it is for norms of rationality to generate “requirements”. Once this is realized and a suitable alternative model is adopted, it becomes possible to accept conflict cases without the pressure to modify or reject the norms.
